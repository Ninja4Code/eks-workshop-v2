You already saw your personal dashboard. From it, there is 3 actions that will be of interest:

1 - In the **Event Outputs** section. Copy the password from the IdePassword field and use the URL from the **IdeUrl** field and open it in a new browser tab, this will be the main windows you'll use for this workshop :

When you will prompted for a password, use the IdePassword field from that output.
